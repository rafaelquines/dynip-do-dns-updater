# dynip-do-dns-updater
It's a node app to update your DNS record on Digital Ocean with your dynamic ip

To run locally, create a .env file with the following variables:

- DO_API_KEY => Your Digital Ocean API KEY
- DOMAIN_NAME => Your domain (mywebsite.com)
- RECORD_TYPE => DNS Record Type (Default: A)
- RECORD_NAME => Your DNS Records separated by commas (home,server,office,etc).
This config will update each DNS with your dynamic ip
- INTERVAL => Time interval in minutes to verify ip and updates DNS record (Default: 60)
- LOCAL_INTERFACE => Update DNS record with internal IP from this interface name (eth0, eth1, etc...)

or use my docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/rafaelquines/dynip-do-dns-updater/

In the `sample` directory, you can see the files needed to run the application.
